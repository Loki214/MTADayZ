### Synopsis ###
This repository serves as a "hub" for the development of MTA DayZ, a gamemode which is akin to the DayZ mod for ArmA II, only for MTA (Multi Theft Auto).
The aim is to reproduce the gameplay and atmosphere of the mod (as close as possible, at the very least). 
In the past, MTA DayZ used to be compiled, but now that it's open source, there's hope that development will be much more active, with people contributing
to make this gamemode even better.

### What should I do? ###
